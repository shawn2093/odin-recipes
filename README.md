## Odin Recipes

A simple HTML project from The Odin Project to practice foundational web skills. It showcases a minimal recipe website with multiple pages linked from a main index.

### Features
- **Static HTML pages**: No frameworks or build tools required
- **Semantic structure**: Headings, lists, and links
- **Multi-page navigation**: `index.html` links to individual recipe pages

### Tech Stack
- **HTML5** only

### Project Structure
```
odin-recipes/
├─ index.html            # Landing page linking to recipes
├─ recipes/
│  ├─ lasagna.html
│  ├─ burger.html
│  └─ salad.html
└─ README.md
```

### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shawn2093/odin-recipes.git
   cd odin-recipes
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
   - Double-click `index.html`, or
   - Serve locally (optional):
     ```bash
     python3 -m http.server 8080
     # then visit http://localhost:8080
     ```

### What I Practiced
- Creating a simple multi-page site
- Using relative links between pages
- Organizing files and basic project structure

### Future Improvements
- Add images and alt text for accessibility
- Include ingredients and step lists with proper semantics
- Add basic CSS styling for layout and typography
